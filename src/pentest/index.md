# Penetration testing - Pentest

## Introduction to penetration testing

Definitions:

- **Risk assessment**: Analysis of services to identify vulnerabilities in systems, applications or processes.
- **Penetration testing**: Check if the vulnerabilities found are really present or not (false positives).
