# Drozer

Drozer is a good tool for simulating a rogue application. F-Secure stopped its development, but it still can be used in your penetration test without any problems. From their GitHub page, there is an [APK][1] that should be installed on the device. The command is

```shell
$ adb install drozer-agent-2.3.4.apk
```

Drozer allows you to search for security vulnerabilities in apps and devices by assuming the role of an app and interacting with the Dalvik VM, other appsâ€™ IPC endpoints, and the underlying OS. Even though it is decommissioned and out of development, I still use it as a go-to tool when it comes to mobile pentesting. More details can be found on their [GitHub][2].

```shell
$ wget https://github.com/WithSecureLabs/drozer/releases/download/2.4.4/drozer_2.4.4.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i drozer-2.4.4.deb
```
