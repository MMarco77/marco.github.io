# Natural Referencing

## The domain name

- avoid `-` which are considered as penalizing
- it's better without offensive words and easy to spell
- the size of the domain name must be about 9 words
- register your domain name for 1 year or less is characterized as suspicious
- a valid SSL certificate is better


## Page construction

- you need keywords related to your site
- the content of the pages must be relevant and organized
- if the speed of loading the page is long ( Ex: images too heavy) your site will be less well referenced
- it is preferable to have a qualitative code
- feature snippets: this is a portion of text that directly answers a question asked in the search engine. Indeed, it is an extract that leads the user to click on the page to get the full content. Try the site [Answer The Public](answerthepublic.com) to know what people are looking for on Google (could be interested to look for your keywords).


## Backlinks

Links that lead to your website. For Google, if a site has many backlinks, it is a popular and quality site. It also takes into account the age of the domain name that makes the incoming link. Indeed, there is a difference between Wikipedia and a site that is a few months old.

It takes into account the link that redirects to your site.

- the complete site (https://your-own-site.com), the complete site is considered of quality
- a specific page of your site (https://your-own-site.com/a/very/specific/page/somewhere/in/your/site), there is only one interesting content.

## User loyalty

- The more time they spend on the site, the better.
- Encourage users to comment on content. Many comments involve a topic of interest, so users will return to the site to see the responses (⚠️ to moderation).
